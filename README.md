# test_SOAP_predictor

This is a test run of a ML framework needed to predict the SOAP molecular descriptor out of the graph of a molecule.

The model in this branch is identical to the one in the reshaping-based SOAP predictor, but with a shallower SOAP predictor head in the the SOAP predictor block.

Training will initially be carried out on this model.

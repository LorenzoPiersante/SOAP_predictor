# SOAP_predictor

This is a test run of a ML framework needed to predict the SOAP molecular descriptor out of the graph of a molecule.

Refer to https://github.com/LorenzoPiersante/AFM_model_SOAP_in_features/blob/main/project_report_Piersante.pdf for an explanation of the project.

The type of geometrical descriptor I am referring to is the version outlined in this page: https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/1.0.x/tutorials/descriptors/soap.html
